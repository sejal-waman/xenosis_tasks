**Here are the descriptions for the functionalities of the five Java programs**


1. **Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion**: This program takes a decimal number as input and converts it to its equivalent hexadecimal representation.
 The conversion is done by dividing the decimal number by 16 and using the remainder to form the hexadecimal digits.

2. **Number-Increasing Reverse Pyramid Pattern**: This program prints a reverse pyramid pattern where each row starts with the number 1 and increases up to the current row number.
 The number of rows decreases with each subsequent line.

3. **Hollow Diamond Pyramid**: This program prints a hollow diamond pattern using loops.
 The pattern consists of a diamond shape where the outer boundary of the diamond is printed, and the inside remains empty.

4. **Person Class with Properties and Method**: This program defines a Person class with two properties: name (String) and age (int).
 It includes a method displayDetails that prints the person's name and age. An instance of the class is created in the main method,
 and the displayDetails method is called to display the information.

5. **Exception Handling with Try, Catch, and Finally**: This program prompts the user to input a number and attempts to divide a fixed number (e.g., 10) by the user-provided number.
   It uses try, catch, and finally blocks to handle potential exceptions, such as division by zero. The catch block handles the exceptions by printing appropriate messages,
   and the finally block ensures that any cleanup operations are performed regardless of whether an exception occurred.
